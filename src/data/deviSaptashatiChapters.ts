The Devi Mahatmya, also known as the 'Durga Saptashati', is a Divine Book of the Soul—helping to understand Consciousness of the Universe.

The Divine Mother, through Divine Allegory, explains the workings of Her Play (Leela) as the World and Life, and describes clearly how human Consciousness and the Consciousness of the Universe works and how to live life properly.

ॐ ऋषिरुवाच ॥

Long ago, in the age of the manu Svarociba, there arose from the line of Caitra a king named Suratha, who ruled over the whole earth.

He looked after his subjects justly, as if they were his own children. But there were princes at that time who attacked the native hill tribes and became his enemies.

Though mightily armed and resolved to fight against them, he suffered defeat in battle, despite his enemies' inferior forces.

And so, with only his native province left to rule, he returned to his own city. There, powerful adversaries set upon him, the illustrious Suratha now bereft of strength.

His ministers, mighty, corrupted, and disposed to evil, seized power and plundered the treasury, even there in his own city.

Thus robbed of his dominion, the king mounted his horse on the pretext of hunting and rode off alone into the dense forest.

He came upon the hermitage of Medhas, chief among the twice-born, and beheld a forest retreat, graced by the sage's disciples. There he saw beasts once wild now peacefully abiding.

Welcomed by the sage, he remained at the hermitage for some time, wandering here and there about the enclosure.`

"Who are you," he asked, "and what brings you here? Why do you look so sorrowful and dejected?"

Hearing the king speak in friendship, the merchant bowed respectfully and replied.

वैश्य उवाच ॥

"I am a merchant named Samadhi, born in a wealthy family. My wife and children grew wicked through avarice and cast me out.

Destitute of riches, wife, and children, my wealth taken from me, I have arrived in the forest, distressed and forsaken by trusted kinsmen.

Being here, I know not whether good fortune or ill has befallen my children, wife, and family."

राजोवाच ॥

The king said: "Those greedy sons, wife, and others who dispossessed you of your wealth—why does your mind still cherish them?"

वैश्य उवाच ॥

The merchant replied: "Even as you say it, this very thought occurs to me. But what can I do? My heart is not inclined to rancor but still turns with affection to those who drove me away, scorning love for father, husband, and kinsman, out of lust for wealth.

I recognize this, O wise one. Still, I do not understand how my thoughts are drawn in love to my unworthy kinsfolk.

Because of them I sigh, overcome with despair. What can I do, since the pain has failed to harden my heart?"

Then together they approached the sage, that merchant named Samadhi and Suratha, the best of kings.`

The seer said:

"Illustrious king, through the perceptions of the senses, every living being has knowledge of the manifest universe. The objects of sense-perception reveal themselves in various ways.

Some creatures are blind by day, and others are blind by night. Some creatures see equally by day and night.

Truly, humans are endowed with the power of perception, but they are not alone, for cattle, birds, wild animals, and all other living creatures also perceive.

That awareness which humans have, birds and beasts possess also; and their awareness, humans have, too. In other ways also the two are similar.

Look at these birds. Though feeling the pangs of hunger, out of delusion they still busy themselves by dropping food into the beaks of their young.

Illustrious sir, humans long for offspring, surely expecting gratitude in return. Do you not see this?

In this very manner they are hurled into the whirlpool of attachment, the pit of delusion, by the power of Mahamaya, Who produces the continuing cycle of this transitory world.

Do not be astonished. This same Mahamaya is Yoganidra, the meditative sleep of Vishnu, the lord of the world. By Her this world is deluded.

She, the blessed Goddess Mahamaya, seizes the minds of even the wise and draws them into delusion.

She creates all this universe, moving and unmoving, and it is She Who graciously bestows liberation on humanity.

She is the supreme knowledge and the eternal cause of liberation, even as She is the cause of bondage to this transitory existence. She is the sovereign of all lords."`

Then two fearsome asuras, the notorious Madhu and Kaitabha, issued forth from the wax in Vishnu's ears, intent on slaying Brahma, who was seated on the lotus that grew from Vishnu's navel.

When he saw the raging asuras and the sleeping Vishnu, Brahma could think of nothing but to awaken him, and to that end he extolled Yoganidra, Who had settled over Vishnu's eyes.

ब्रह्मोवाच ॥

Brahma said:

"You Are The Mantras of Consecration to the Gods and the ancestors. At Your Bidding They Are Uttered, and they are your very embodiment.

You Are The Nectar of Immortality, O Imperishable, Eternal One. Truly, You Abide As The Transcendent Being.

Thus Extolled, O Devi, may You with Your Exalted Powers Confound Those Unassailable asuras, Madhu and Kaitabha.

Let Vishnu, the lord of the world, be quickly awakened from his slumber and be roused to slay the two great asuras."

ऋषिरुवाच ॥

Praised thus by the creator to rouse Vishnu into slaying Madhu and Kaitabha, The Dark Goddess emerged from his eyes, mouth, nostrils, arms, heart, and chest, and appeared before Brahma.

And released by Her, Vishnu arose and fought with the demons for five thousand years. Confounded by Mahamaya, they offered him a boon.

Vishnu said: "I will surely slay both of you now."

Beholding that the world consisted entirely of water, they said: "Slay us where water does not flood the earth."

Taking the two of them onto his lap, he cut off their heads with his discus.

Thus did The Devi Herself appear when praised by Brahma.`

ऋषिरुवाच ॥

"Long ago, when Mahisha was chief of the asuras and Indra was chief of the gods, there was a war between their forces for a full hundred years.

The valorous asuras vanquished the army of the gods, and after all were conquered, Mahishasura became the lord of heaven.

Then led by Brahma, the defeated gods went to Vishnu and Shiva and related in detail what had happened:

'He has usurped the authority of Surya, Indra, Agni, Vayu, and Chandra, and of Yama, Varuna, and all the others.

Cast out from heaven by the evil Mahisha, all the multitudes of gods wander over the earth as mere mortals.

We have related all that this foe of the gods has done, and we seek refuge in You. Be pleased to devise a means for his destruction.'

When Vishnu and Shiva heard the entreaties of the gods, they knit their brows in fury, whereupon a great radiance came forth from Vishnu's rage-filled countenance, and so, too, from Brahma's and Shiva's.

And from Indra's body and from the bodies of all the other gods, a very great light issued, and it united and became one.

The gods saw before them a peak of light like a mountain, blazing brightly and pervading the sky in every direction with its flames.

Unequaled light, born from the bodies of all the gods, coalesced into a female form and pervaded the three worlds with its splendor."`

Her feet took shape from Brahma's light and Her toes from Surya's brilliance. From the Vasus' light Her fingers formed and from Kubera's light, Her nose.

From Prajapati's lustre came Her teeth, and from Agni's radiance Her three eyes were born.

Dawn and dusk became Her eyebrows, the wind god's splendor shaped Her ears, and all else born of the other gods' light shone too as the auspicious Devi.

Then, beholding Her who appeared from out of their amassed light, all those gods, tormented by Mahisha, rejoiced.

Then the gods bestowed on Her their own weapons and adornments. From his trident Shiva drew forth another and gave it to Her, and Vishnu bestowed a discus spun out from his own.

Varuna gave Her a conch; and Agni, the eater of oblations, gave Her a spear.

Vayu presented a bow and two quivers filled with arrows. Indra gave Her a thunderbolt and a bell from Airavata.

Yama gave Her a staff. Brahma gave prayer beads and an ascetic's waterpot.

Surya bestowed his rays of sunlight on all the pores of Her skin; and Kala, the lord of time, presented a sword and shining shield.

The ocean of milk bestowed a necklace of flawless pearls, ever-new garments, a celestial crest-jewel, earrings, bracelets, and shining anklets.

Himalaya gave Her a lion to ride upon and jewels of many kinds.`

Honored also by the other gods with adornments and weapons, the Devi laughed thunderously and defiantly again and again.

She filled the entire sky with Her terrible roar, and from the immeasurable din a great echo resounded. All the worlds shook, and the oceans churned. The earth quaked, and the mountains heaved.

In joy the gods exclaimed, 'Victory!' to the lion-mounted Devi; and with bodies bowed in devotion, the sages praised Her.

When the enemies of the gods saw the three worlds in upheaval, they readied all their forces for battle and rose up as one, with weapons held high.

'Aha! What is this?' Mahishasura bellowed in wrath. Surrounded by countless asuras, he rushed toward the sound.

And then beheld the Devi, who pervaded the three worlds with Her radiance, bending the earth under Her tread, scraping the sky with Her diadem, shaking all the nether regions with the resonance of Her bowstring, and standing there, penetrating every direction with Her thousand arms.

Now when he saw the army being slaughtered, Ciksura, the great asura general, went forth in fury to battle with Ambika.

He rained showers of arrows on the Devi in the combat, just as a raincloud showers the summit of Mount Meru.

But easily shattering his volley, the Devi killed his steeds and charioteer with Her arrows. Like lightning, She slashed through his bow and highflying banner.`

But Mahishasura, great in valor, struck the earth angrily with his hooves, flung mountains skyward with his horns, and bellowed frightfully.

Under his frenzied wheeling, the trampled earth broke apart. Lashed by his tail, the ocean overflowed all around.

Thrashed by his horns, the clouds fragmented and dispersed. Tossed about on his blasting breath, mountains by the hundreds fell from the sky.

When She saw the great asura approaching, inflated with rage, Chandika aroused Her wrath and prepared to slay him.

She threw Her noose over him and bound him. Fettered thus in the fierce battle, the great asura left his buffalo form and assumed the shape of a lion.

No sooner had Ambika severed his head than he appeared as a man with sword in hand. Instantly, with Her arrows the Devi cut him to shreds. Then he took the form of a great elephant.

While he trumpeted loudly, the Devi chopped off his trunk with Her sword. Once more the great asura assumed his buffalo form and caused the three worlds to tremble.

देवी उवाच ॥

"Bellow, you fool, bellow for now while I drink this potion. After I have slain you, the gods will cheer in this very place."

Having declared that, She leapt upon the great asura, pinned his neck down with Her foot, and pierced him through with Her spear.

Half-revealed and fighting still, that great asura fell to the Devi, beheaded by Her great sword.

Then crying out in alarm, the whole demon army perished, and all the divine hosts exulted.`

The world attains happiness when You slay its foes, and though they may have committed enough evil to keep them long in torment, even as You strike down our enemies, O Devi, You think, 'May they reach heaven through death in battle with Me.'

Why do not all the asuras perish merely at the sight of You? It is because You wish even those sinners to reach heaven by meeting You in combat.

Those to whom You are bounteous are honored among peoples, theirs are riches, theirs are glories, and their righteous acts know no limit. They indeed are blessed with devoted children, attendants, and wives."

"O gods, those who praise Me daily with these hymns shall be protected by Me from all calamity.

In ages past, there were two asura brothers named Shumbha and Nishumbha, who through their penances had gained invincibility.

They conquered the three worlds and usurped the powers of all the gods. Indra, Surya, Chandra, Kubera, Yama, Varuna—all lost their domains.

The gods remembered the Devi's promise and went to the Himalayas to praise Her. As they chanted hymns, Parvati came to bathe in the waters of the Ganga.

She asked them, "Whom do you praise?" From Her body emerged Ambika, the auspicious one, who answered: "This hymn is addressed to Me. Shumbha and Nishumbha have caused the gods' suffering. I will fulfill the promise made long ago."

That Devi, who emerged from Parvati's body, is known as Kaushiki. Parvati, now dark in complexion after Ambika's emergence, is known as Kalika.

The asura Chanda and Munda saw the beautiful Devi seated on a mountaintop and reported to Shumbha:

"O King, a woman of unsurpassed beauty dwells on the snowy peak. Such loveliness has never been seen before. Find out who she is and make her yours."

Shumbha sent his messenger Sugriva to the Devi with proposals of marriage. But She replied:

देवी उवाच ॥

"I have made a foolish vow that only he who conquers me in battle shall be my husband. Send Shumbha or Nishumbha to fight me."

Shumbha, enraged, sent Dhumralochana with sixty thousand asuras to bring her by force. The Devi reduced him to ashes with a single syllable "Hum."`

When Dhumralochana was slain, Shumbha sent Chanda and Munda with vast armies to capture the Devi.

They saw Her seated calmly on Her lion on the golden peak of the great mountain, and they approached to seize Her.

The Devi, seeing the vast army approach, became filled with wrath. Her face turned dark as ink with rage.

From Her furrowed brow suddenly sprang forth Kali, of terrifying countenance, wielding sword and noose.

She carried a strange skull-topped staff, wore a garland of human skulls, and was draped in a tiger's skin. Her emaciated flesh was dreadful to behold.

Her wide-gaping mouth, with lolling tongue, her sunken, reddened eyes, filled all directions with her roars.

She fell upon the great asuras in that army, slaying them with abandon. She devoured their forces—elephants, charioteers, horses, and foot soldiers alike.

Seizing Chanda by the hair, she severed his head with her sword. Then Munda rushed at her, and him too she struck down.

Carrying the heads of Chanda and Munda, she approached Chandika and laughed aloud:

काली उवाच ॥

"Here I bring you Chanda and Munda, great beasts slaughtered in the sacrifice of battle. Shumbha and Nishumbha you yourself shall slay."

Then from the bodies of Brahma, Shiva, Karttikeya, Vishnu, and Indra emerged their Shaktis in female form.

The Shakti of Shiva took the form of Maheshvari, mounted on a bull, holding a trident.

From Vishnu came Vaishnavi, seated on Garuda, bearing conch, discus, mace, and bow.

From Brahma came Brahmani, seated on a swan, with prayer beads and waterpot.

From Indra came Aindri, thunderbolt in hand, mounted on Airavata.

From Karttikeya came Kaumari, spear in hand, riding a peacock.

The Shakti of Varaha emerged as Varahi, in boar form. Narasimhi appeared in the form of Narasimha.

Then from the Devi's body came forth a terrible Shakti called Chandika, howling like a hundred jackals.

She told Shiva: "Go as my messenger to Shumbha and Nishumbha. Tell them to return the three worlds to the gods or fall in battle."

Because Shiva himself carried this message, the Devi is known as Shivaduti.

When the asura Raktabija entered the battle, from every drop of his blood that fell to earth, another demon of equal might arose. The Devi commanded Chamunda:

"O Chamunda, open your mouth wide and drink his blood as I strike him. Let not a single drop fall to earth."

The Matrikas—Kali, Shivaduti, Brahmani, Maheshvari, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Aindri, and Narasimhi—fell upon the demon armies.

With trident, discus, sword, spear, and other weapons, they tore through the asura ranks.

Nishumbha, undaunted, rushed at the Devi with sword and shield. The Devi shattered his sword with swift-flying arrows.

He hurled a spear, but She split it in flight. He raised his mace—She smashed it with a hundred arrows.

Rushing forward with fist raised, he struck the Devi on the heart. She struck him with the palm of Her hand, and he fell to the ground.

Rising again, he seized the Devi, lifting Her into the sky. But even unsupported there, She struck him again and again.

He fell to earth but rose once more and rushed at Her. With Her trident, the Devi pinned him.

He split in two, and from the cloven body emerged another form to continue fighting.

The Devi, laughing, severed that head too with Her sword. Thus fell Nishumbha, slain by the Devi of the cosmos.`

Wounded but furious, Shumbha seized the Devi and rose into the sky. There too, unsupported, they fought.

The asura Shumbha battled Her in the sky, astounding all the Siddhas and sages who watched.

Whoever recites this account of My glory with devotion shall find Me their protector in times of difficulty.

Those who hear with faith this tale of My deeds—the slaying of Madhu and Kaitabha, of Mahishasura, and of Shumbha and Nishumbha—and My future incarnations, shall be freed from all their sins.

On the ninth day of the bright fortnight of autumn, those who worship Me with devotion shall have all their desires fulfilled.

Those who remember Me—I who was born as Nanda's daughter, who am called Rakta-dantika and Shakambhari and Durga, who slays Durgama—to them I shall grant success."

Thus the blessed Devi, having pronounced these boons, vanished while the gods looked on.`

ऋषिरुवाच ॥

The seer said to King Suratha and the merchant Samadhi:

"I have related to you the supreme glory of the Devi. Such is the power of the Goddess—She by whom this world is upheld.

Knowledge is imparted by Her, the blessed Vishnu-maya. You and this merchant and others of good sense are deluded by Her.

Resort to Her, the supreme sovereign. She, when worshipped, grants humans enjoyment, heaven, and liberation."

The king and the merchant then went to the riverbank and practiced severe austerities for three years, worshipping the Devi with clay images, flowers, incense, and fire.

After three years, Chandika, Mother of the world, appeared before them and spoke:

चण्डिका उवाच ॥

"Choose a boon, O king. I am pleased with your devotion and will grant what you desire."

राजोवाच ॥

The king said: "O Goddess, grant me my kingdom, undecaying in this life and the next, and victory over my enemies who have conquered my land."

Then the merchant spoke:

वैश्योवाच ॥

"O Goddess, I am afflicted by attachment to children and wife who have abandoned me. Grant me detachment and the knowledge that leads to liberation."

चण्डिका उवाच ॥

The Devi replied: "O king, you shall regain your kingdom after slaying your enemies. In your next life, you shall be born as the son of the Sun god and shall become the Manu called Savarni.

O noble merchant, I grant you the knowledge you seek. Through wisdom you shall be freed from all attachment and attain final liberation."

Having granted these boons, the Devi vanished.

The king, reborn through the Devi's grace, became the eighth Manu, known as Savarni. The merchant attained supreme knowledge and liberation.

॥ इति श्री मार्कण्डेय पुराणे देवी माहात्म्यं सम्पूर्णम् ॥

Thus ends the Devi Mahatmya from the Markandeya Purana.`
